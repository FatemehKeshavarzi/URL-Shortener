# 📘 README - Midterm Final Checklist
This README **must remain in your repository** and **must be fully
completed** before submitting the midterm.
---
## 1. API Test Coverage Table
Fill in the second column with the **name of the student** who implemented
and tested each API.
| # | API Endpoint / Feature | Implemented & Tested By (Student Name) |
|---|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1 | Create Short Link - **POST /links** | Alice |
13
| 2 | Redirect to Original URL - **GET /{code}** | Bob |
| 3 | Get All Shortened Links - **GET /links** | Alice |
| 4 | Delete Short Link - **DELETE /links/{code}** | Bob |
---
## 2. Code Generation Method (Section 6.4)
Check the method you used to generate the short code:
- [ ] **1. Random Generation**
- [x] **2. ID → Base62 Conversion**
- [ ] **3. Hash-based Generation**
(Only select the one you actually implemented.)
---
## 3. Bonus User Story: TTL (Expiration Time) for Shortened Links)
If you implemented the bonus user story, mark the box and complete the
required details.
- [x] **TTL Feature Implemented**
**If checked, fill in the following information:**
- **ENV variable or config key used:**
`LINK_TTL_SECONDS=400`
You must also ensure this key exists in `.env.example` with a sample value.
- **Location of TTL Logic (File + Function):**
Specify the exact location where TTL expiration is checked and expired
links are detected/removed.
`services/link_service.py → delete_expired_links()`
- **How TTL cleanup is triggered:**
You must write a Command that removes expired links (created_at + TTL <
now()).
Here, write:
- Full file path of the command
- Command name / execution method
- Scheduler details

## 4. Postman Collection (Required)
A **Postman Collection** has been created and includes all four API routes:
- **POST /links**
- **GET /{code}**
- **GET /links**
- **DELETE /links/{code}**
### Screenshots (included in GitHub)
For each route, two screenshots have been added:
- Successful response (2xx)
- Error-handled response (4xx)
Screenshots are located in:
```
/postman
```
### Naming Example:
```
postman/
post-links-201-success.png
post-links-400-invalid-url.png
get-code-302-redirect.png
get-code-404-not-found.png
get-links-200-success.png
delete-code-200-success.png
delete-code-404-not-found.png

```
Filenames must clearly show:
- Route
- HTTP status
- Success or error
